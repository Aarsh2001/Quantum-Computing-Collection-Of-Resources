I shall be maintaining this folder of my Repository with all the Resources and my Personal Learnings and Looked-Up References during this week long Workshop.

## About The Workshop

<To be completed>
<As QWorld, we are happy to announce that we are organizing an online and free introductory workshop on quantum computing and programming. The workshop will be held online between November 23 and November 28 and there is no registration fee. During the workshop, we will use our introductory material Bronze which consists of around 30 Jupyter notebooks involving theoretical content and practical tasks. 

The content of the workshop includes:
- The basic elements of quantum computation,
- A few basic quantum algorithms representing the power of quantum computation,
- Writing basic quantum programs.
 
Participants will be watching the prerecorded lecture videos and completing the tasks on their own. Each day, there will be a live session conducted in Zoom as well as live mentor support which will be provided from Discord. You will be asked to pick one of the two time-slots for the live sessions and mentoring. 

Application dates are between October  29 - November 16. Applications later than the deadline won’t be taken into consideration. 

Requisites for application:
- Programming experience in Python 
- Basic knowledge of matrices and linear algebra
- English proficiency
- Performing necessary installations (Anaconda, Qiskit, etc.)

Application procedure:
- Please fill out the application form and complete the test
- The application of a minor (14 to 17 years old) should be completed together with his or her guardian.
- Accepted participants are going to be notified by November 16

Participants who complete the daily assignments successfully will receive a Bronze Diploma.>

<Content
Bronze is an introductory quantum programming tutorial that uses Qiskit framework as the quantum programming language. Each notebook consists of some theoretical background about the subject, and programming tasks. While it seems like a quantum programming tutorial, quantum computing concepts are eventually taught through programming.

Bronze is designed for everyone with basic programming knowledge in Python and linear algebra. No background in physics is required as it follows an approach where quantum computing is viewed as a generalization of probabilistic and classical computing.

The content is divided into 5 sections.
– Basics of classical systems
– Basics of quantum systems
– Quantum operators on a real-valued qubit
– Quantum correlation
– Grover’s search algorithm

The tutorial starts with classical and probabilistic systems and the quantum concepts are introduced gradually. Bronze does not involve any complex numbers which facilitates the learning process and allows visualization of states and gates in 2D plane. After introducing the basic concepts like superposition and entanglement, superdense coding and quantum teleportation protocols come forward. Subjects like phase kickback, controlled operations, and multiple qubits serve as a preliminary for the last section, Grover’s search algorithm.>
