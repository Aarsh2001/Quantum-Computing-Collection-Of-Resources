I shall be maintaining this folder of my Repository with all the Resources and my Personal Learnings and Looked-Up References during this week long Workshop.

## About The Workshop

QWorld organized an online and free introductory workshop on quantum computing and programming. The workshop will be held online between November 23 to 28, 2020.

The content of the workshop includes:

- The basic elements of quantum computation,

- A few basic quantum algorithms representing the power of quantum computation,

- Writing basic quantum programs.

Pre-requisites:

- Programming experience in Python 

- Basic knowledge of matrices and linear algebra

- English proficiency

- Performing necessary installations (Anaconda, Qiskit, etc.)

*Participants who complete the daily assignments successfully receive a Bronze Diploma.*

## Content

Bronze is an introductory quantum programming tutorial that uses Qiskit framework as the quantum programming language. Each notebook consists of some theoretical background about the subject, and programming tasks. While it seems like a quantum programming tutorial, quantum computing concepts are eventually taught through programming.

Bronze is designed for everyone with basic programming knowledge in Python and linear algebra. No background in physics is required as it follows an approach where quantum computing is viewed as a generalization of probabilistic and classical computing.

The content is divided into 5 sections.

– Basics of classical systems

– Basics of quantum systems

– Quantum operators on a real-valued qubit

– Quantum correlation

– Grover’s search algorithm

The tutorial starts with classical and probabilistic systems and the quantum concepts are introduced gradually. 

Bronze does not involve any complex numbers which facilitates the learning process and allows visualization of states and gates in 2D plane. After introducing the basic concepts like superposition and entanglement, superdense coding and quantum teleportation protocols come forward. 

Subjects like phase kickback, controlled operations, and multiple qubits serve as a preliminary for the last section, Grover’s search algorithm will be covered.
